Quick note on usage of terminal: use `<C-z>` to hide current process, `fg` to revoke the hidden process. 


# R Critisisms

Upon some internet research and a quick glimpes into the documentation, I found no support to use math symbols in plots generated by R following the TeX convention. 
The R language use functions like `expression(paste(...))`, a confusion, poorly documented syntax without support to rare symbols. I have to use the unicode encoding to render some symbol in the R plot: extremely un-convenient practice.

## Important Difference compared with C

### Memory Allocation

C use `malloc, calloc, realloc` for memory allocation. C++ use `new` and `delete`. Importantly, c++ does not have a build in function for memory reallocation. Use resizable data structure like `vector` instead.

### struct in cpp is considered a public class

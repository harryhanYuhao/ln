# Note for Cpp 
Based on the *C++ Programming Language* by Bjarne.

## Part I: Introductory Material

### The Basics

int`*` p // it denotes p is pointer 

`*` denotes the contents of
& denotes the address of 
to address the value stored in a pointer, use `*` before it. Here: `*p`

`&` denotes reference to

`int a {12}` // here it assigns the a to the value of 12;

exceptions throws error at run time, not compile time.

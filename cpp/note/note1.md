# Note for Cpp 
Based on the *C++ Programming Language* by Bjarne.

## Compiler and Linkers
Cpp files are compiled and linked to form machine code.
Header files (extention `.h`) are special. Each	`#include` statement are replaced by the content of the header file before compilation and linking. 

## Part I: Introductory Material

### The Basics

int`*` p // it denotes p is pointer 

`*` denotes the contents of
& denotes the address of 
to address the value stored in a pointer, use `*` before it. Here: `*p`
`new int[]` // new operator return a pointer

`&` denotes reference to

`int a {12}` // here it assigns the a to the value of 12;

exceptions throws error at run time, not compile time.

### Casting and Conversions

 C99 and C11 ยง6.3.1.2/1 When any scalar value is converted to `_Bool`, the result is 0 if the value compares equal to 0; otherwise, the result is 1.

### Abstractions Mechanisms

## Part II: Basics Facilities

### Pointers, Arrays, and Reference


# Difficult topics

## Those must be mastered

### Pointers, Arrays, and Reference, and iterators

### Classes

### Templates

### Exception Handling

### Input and Output

### The Standard Library

### Concurrency

## Those are good to know

### The C++ Preprocessor

### Namespaces

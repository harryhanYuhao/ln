## Useful Features

### Type Hint

Type hint for functions:

```python 
def foo(a: int = 1, b: str) -> str:
    pass
```

Type hint for variables:

```Python
a: int = 1
b: str = 'a'
c: an_arbitray_word = 2 # type hint can be anything. Type hint is not enforced.
```

Python type hints are not enforced; no errors would be raises if the type of the variable and type hints disagree. It is merely a 'hint'; in fact, any arbitrary words can be a type hint.

## Formatted String

`s = 'The value of n is {}, and the value of k is {}.'.format(n, k)`

### Floating Point Decimal Places


`print("pi = {i:>p.df}".format(np.pi, np.pi*2))` 

i is the index, p is the place shift, d is the decimal place.

The `>` sign means align to right, `<` for left, `^` for center.

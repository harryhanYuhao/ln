# Coding Logs

## 2023

### May 21

Successful implementation of function `textbufDeleteChar` and `textbufInputChar`. These two functions rely heavily on dynamic memory management and are prone to 'off-by-one' error. Anormalties still remains mainly because I have hard coded the "paddings" for showing line numbers. 


### May 25

Created the struct `key` for keylistening. The modifiers of many declarations are justed to unsigned or const where appropriate.
